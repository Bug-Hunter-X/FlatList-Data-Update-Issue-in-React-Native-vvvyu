This React Native bug is related to the interaction between FlatList and its data source. When updating the data source using the setState method, the FlatList might not re-render correctly if the update doesn't change the reference of the data array.  This often happens when you modify the array in place using methods like splice or push.  This leads to a visual glitch where the list doesn't update to show the changes.
