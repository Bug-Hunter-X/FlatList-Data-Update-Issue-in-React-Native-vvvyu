# React Native FlatList Data Update Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native where the FlatList component fails to re-render properly after updating its data source array using in-place modification methods (e.g., push, splice).  The problem is that these methods mutate the original array, and React's shallow comparison doesn't detect the change unless a new array reference is provided.  The solution involves creating a new array with the updated data, ensuring that the FlatList receives a new reference and rerenders accordingly. 

## Bug Description
The bug is related to the FlatList component not updating its display when the underlying data array is changed using in-place array modification techniques. This results in the user interface not reflecting the latest data changes.
